Hi, I’m Yash Swaminathan, a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. With hands‑on internship experience, I’ve built full‑stack web applications that solve real‑world problems and delight users.

As an aspiring CFA charterholder, I’m committed to expanding my analytical and financial acumen alongside my current Engineering Knowledge. I enjoy backend development—designing efficient database schemas, crafting RESTful APIs, and optimizing server‑side performance.

I tackle every challenge with curiosity and optimism—believing that each line of code and every new concept learned brings me one step closer to creating meaningful solutions. I thrive in collaborative environments and firmly believe that a positive attitude and relentless perseverance can turn ambitious ideas into real impact.
